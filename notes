Thursday:
  Button Plays track

  Add simple index to Explore!
  username links to show page (how to get username?)
  Maybe I should be getting all tracks from the track store...


Friday:
  Auth
  Work on forms - add extra elements and style
  create track form and navbar button (similar to update track form?)

Weekend:
  Track show page

Fix delete dialog! -> add to a dialog store, have index register to rerender (not index item)
Display errors on forms -> let me guess... error store!

track - public/private
separate CSS files
user enter to submit form from last field
